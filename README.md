# Yelp Recommendation
Are you sick of seeing primitive recommendation like these

The goal of this repository is to create general purpose recommendation engine based on the Yelp dataset. Why bother with Tabular data based ML tasks when you can do some Deep Learning, you ask? Well, the setup of the project does eventually involve a Deep Learning model. The overall setup attempts to clear suitable bottlenecks when using Deep Learning models when you have dense high dimensional data as well as categorical/slightly continuous tabular data.
What this means is that we will be able to utilize all the of the various data made available via the yelp dataset(Text, Image, histroical checkins/reviews) all together in a single model. Not only will this have a significant edge over memory based status quo techniques but also solve the cold start issue.This way, when we utilize model interpretable algorithms, it gives us a chance to assign impact to every possible feature that may influence a choice, making this analysis a useful service to businesses as well.
